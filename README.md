# Height-Identifier-from-Phone
If someone takes a mirror selfie with their head and phone visible, this program can identify their height.

To run the python program, don't just press run, enter: <br />
python3 main.py --image _FILE NAME_ --config yolov3.cfg --weights yolov3.weights --classes yolov3.txt
(things in italics need to be replaced)
