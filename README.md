# Height-Identifier-from-Phone
If someone takes a mirror selfie with their head and phone visible, this program can identify their height.

Along with the files in this repository, yolov3.weights needs to be downloaded from this link:<br />
https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights <br/>

To run the python program, don't just press run, enter: <br />
python3 mirror.py --image _FILE NAME_ --config yolov3.cfg --weights yolov3.weights --classes yolov3.txt <br />
(things in italics need to be replaced)
